# 🧠 Analysis of Suicide_Attempt_Review using Machine Learning

This project presents a data-driven approach to suicide risk assessment using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a trustworthy system that can help identify individuals at risk of self-harm based on clinical, behavioral, and demographic data.

---

## 📊 Overview

This research study evaluates and compares two popular ML models for suicide risk prediction:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implemented but achieved lower accuracy.
- **Random Forest**: Outperformed SVM with high precision and recall metrics.

📈 **Performance of Random Forest**:
- **Accuracy**: 0.85  
- **Precision**: 0.85  
- **Recall**: 0.85  
- **F1 Score**: 0.85  

By leveraging preprocessed personal health data, the project shows how machine learning can be used to improve mental health outcomes through early detection and intervention.
